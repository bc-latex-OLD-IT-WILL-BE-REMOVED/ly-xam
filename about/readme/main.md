**Changes for macros like `\exercise`:** the option `note` has been renamed `about`.


**Style `APMEP`:** it loads ``\usepackage{fourier-orns}`` instead of ``\usepackage{fourier}`` to only use the ornements. If you still want to have the previous font loaded by `APMEP`, just add ``\usepackage{pxfonts}`` in your preamble.
