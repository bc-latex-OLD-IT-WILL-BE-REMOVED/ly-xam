**Starting a total refactoring of the code :** we will use a factory so as to ease customizations of styles, internationalization of messages and internal development. Here is what has been done for the moment.

    1) Management of title, headers and footers of an exam.

    2) An API using ``pgfkeys`` gives a very easy way to implement new style (for a Â¨latex developer).

    3) Translation of terms are done locally (even if we will give later a single file to allow efficient translation).
