**New minor version version::``0.3.0-beta`` of Â¨lyxam:** see all the changes from date::``2017-11-29`` to today.


**Two new styles.**

    1) The style ``book`` has been added to write exercises inside a book or a lesson (no delivery material, no headers and footers, and not a title centered).

    2) The style ``ecolo`` mixes the styles ``mini`` and ``book`` such as to print tests wasting less spaces as possible.


**Internal changes :** less ``\def`` commands are used and only necessary ``\gdef`` commands have been kept.
