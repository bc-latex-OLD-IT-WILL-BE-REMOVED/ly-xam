**Two major changes for the styles.**

    1) The style  ``mini`` now prints the sources as footnotes.

    2) The environment ``\begin{absolutelynopagebreak} ... \end{absolutelynopagebreak}`` has been removed because it has some side effects (on footnotes for example).

    1) Two new options ``about`` and ``noabout`` to show or hide the informations about topics, exercises and parts.

    2) The option ``short`` acts now also on texts like ``points``.

**Two options added to the environment `\begin{preamble}...\end{preamble}`.**

    1) The option ``center`` allows to center or not the content of the preamble.

    2) The option ``scale`` gives the width of the preamble obtained by multiplying the width of a line the value of ``scale``.

**New name for the option ``render`` of ``\exam``:** the new name is ``deliver``.


**Minor internal changes.**

    1) The prefix ``@lyxam@`` is used almost everywhere.

    2) Only the booleans from ``etoolbox`` are used in the API for new styles.

**Minor internal changes.**

    1) The macro ``\@if@empty`` to use for new styles should be more robust now.

    2) Better use of the package ``simplekv``: we use "real" empty strings.


**Bug in the style APMEP:** the new internal version didn't manage spaces for topics. This has been corrected.

**New minor version version::``0.1.0-beta`` of ¨lyxam:** see all the changes below.


**Two new options ``hf`` and ``nohf`` for the package:** this is for showing or hiding the headers and footers.


**Changes for `\exam`.**

    1) The option `preamble` has been removed, and all other options are now optional.

    2) The macro `\exam` can be used several times in the same document.


**New environment `\begin{preamble}...\end{preamble}`:** this can be used anywhere.


**Changes for macros like `\exercise`:** the option `note` has been renamed `about`.


**Style `APMEP`:** it loads ``\usepackage{fourier-orns}`` instead of ``\usepackage{fourier}`` to only use the ornements. If you still want to have the previous font loaded by `APMEP`, just add ``\usepackage{pxfonts}`` in your preamble.


**Internal changes.**

    1) The code has been totally rebuild and simplified thanks to the package `simplekv`.

    2) The packages of styles are now really managed.

    3) For styles, there is only one command ``buildlayout`` to be coded.

**Bug in the style APMEP:** the font size command ``\footnotesize`` was missing for page numbers in the footers after the first page.


==========
2017-11-05
==========

**The styles will never use their own font:** the style APMEP uses now ``\usepackage{fourier-orns}`` instead of ``\usepackage{fourier}`` such as to only use the ornaments. The choice of the font is just a user's one.


==========
2017-11-03
==========

**First public version version::``0.0.0-beta`` of ¨lyxam :** because of refactorization, we see the actual project as a new one.


**New way to hide contexts:** the options ``hidectxt`` has been deleted. To hide context, we just have to use star version of macro.


**One new feature coming from Chronos:** the option ``time`` allows to indicate the time of a context.


**One bug found:** the writing of the french documentation shows a case where isolated problems and bonus still have their number: the problem came just from reseting the counters anywhere (this was not intended to be used in an exam, but this will be useful in a book).


==========

**Changes for exercises and co.**

    1) The package options ``ref`` and ``noref`` becomes ``src`` and ``nosrc``. This is more logical !

    2) Two new package options ``pts`` and ``nopts`` allows to see or hide the points. By default, the package shows the points.

    3) The styles no longer need to manage the hiding or showing of points and sources (see the package options ``nosrc`` and ``nopts``). Instead they just know that the points and the sources are empty or not.
