**First public version version::``0.0.0-beta`` of Â¨lyxam :** because of refactorization, we see the actual project as a new one.


**New way to hide contexts:** the options ``hidectxt`` has been deleted. To hide context, we just have to use star version of macro.


**One new feature coming from Chronos:** the option ``time`` allows to indicate the time of a context.


**One bug found:** the writing of the french documentation shows a case where isolated problems and bonus still have their number: the problem came just from reseting the counters anywhere (this was not intended to be used in an exam, but this will be useful in a book).

**Changes for exercises and co.**

    1) The package options ``ref`` and ``noref`` becomes ``src`` and ``nosrc``. This is more logical !

    2) Two new package options ``pts`` and ``nopts`` allows to see or hide the points. By default, the package shows the points.

    3) The styles no longer need to manage the hiding or showing of points and sources (see the package options ``nosrc`` and ``nopts``). Instead they just know that the points and the sources are empty or not.
