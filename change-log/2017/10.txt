**Style APMEP finished:** total factorisation of titles for topics, exercices and co has been done. The API has changed : we use now a key-value interface that is longer to write but easier to use !

**Changes in the style APMEP.**

    1) The way to define new main layouts of exams has been simplified : new layouts will use global constants.

    2) It is now possible to show a frame where the student will write his first and second names.

**Changes in the style APMEP.**

    1) Now there are no indentations for paragraphs inside the preambule (this wanted feature was not tested and so not implemented).

    2) The little descriptions for the documentation has been written (french and english versions done).

**Starting a total refactoring of the code :** we will use a factory so as to ease customizations of styles, internationalization of messages and internal development. Here is what has been done for the moment.

    1) Management of title, headers and footers of an exam.

    2) An API using ``pgfkeys`` gives a very easy way to implement new style (for a Â¨latex developer at least).

    3) Translation of terms are done locally (even if we will give later a single file to allow efficient translation by extrenal none programmers contributors).
